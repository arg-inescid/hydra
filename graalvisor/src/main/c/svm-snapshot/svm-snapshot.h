/*
minimize_syscalls optimizes system calls by filtering the system calls that are
safe to remove.

Currently we are optimzing open/close and mmap/munmap relations, the optimization
logic works as follows:

If a close() is issued to a fd returned by a previous open(), and there weren't
any relevant uses of the fd such as mmap(), then we can remove both system calls.
Because we don't checkpoint socket() sometimes close() is issued on an unexisting
fd, so this system call can also be removed. dup() and dup2() in our context are
functionally equivalent to open() because they return an fd.

If an munmap() is issued to a previously seen returned address from an mmap(), we
check if the address was seen previously, and if so, compares the length. mmap()
returns a page-aligned length due to our seccomp intercepter, so we also add
padding to munmap() length so that it becomes page-aligned and can be compared
correctly with the length of the mmap().
